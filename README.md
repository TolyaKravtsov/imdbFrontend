 ## Description

Basically the app is present as a single-page application presented in the React framework version 18.

According to the assumption to work the main task was creating an application that show favorite movies from the database and able to add and remove movies from it

This logic in my point of view should look like routes, where the first route is a list of all of the movies in which we can choose and pick up favorites, and the route of favorite movies is where we able to remove or see the actual favorite films. 

Obviously, if you're not authorized it you can't see our favorite films so in my realization I remove the possibility to open the favorite films tab when you're not logged in
